# Support Ticket Search System

## Project Title
Support Ticket Search System — TF-IDF + Inverted Index

---

## Objective
A Flask-based web application that allows users to describe a support issue in plain English and instantly find the most relevant matching ticket from a knowledge base. The system uses TF-IDF vectorisation, an inverted index for candidate retrieval, and cosine similarity for ranking — providing transparent, explainable results at every phase of the search pipeline.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** — web framework
- **scikit-learn** — TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity
- **NLTK** — tokenisation, lemmatisation, stop word removal
- **NumPy** — vector operations
- **Gunicorn** — production WSGI server (for deployment)
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — frontend interface

## Installation Steps

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaitheeswarivaithee532-hue/support-ticket-search
cd support-ticket-search
```

**2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Ensure `tickets.txt` is present** in the same folder as `app.py`, formatted as:
```
TICKET_ID|Issue description text|Solution text
```

## How to Run the Application

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```
Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Live Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible at:
```
https://support-ticket-search-63ba.onrender.com/
```

Type a support issue description into the search box and press **Search** (or `Ctrl+Enter`). The system will display ranked matching tickets with similarity scores and solution recommendations.

---

## How It Works

The search pipeline runs in four phases:

1. **Query Analysis** — tokenises the query, expands contractions, removes stop words, and applies lemmatisation + Porter stemming.
2. **Inverted Index Lookup** — uses root tokens to retrieve candidate tickets efficiently.
3. **Cosine Similarity Ranking** — computes TF-IDF weighted cosine similarity between the query and all candidates.
4. **Result Display** — returns top-K ranked results with descriptions, solutions, and per-token similarity breakdowns.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Renders the main search interface |
| POST | `/search` | Accepts `{ "query": "...", "top_k": 3 }`, returns ranked results as JSON |

## tickets.txt Format
Each line must follow this format (no line breaks within a ticket):
```
T001|Description of the issue|Solution steps
```
